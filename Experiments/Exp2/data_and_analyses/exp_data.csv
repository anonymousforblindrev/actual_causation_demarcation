Most of the questions in that section were easy to answer. But two were confusing. In the video, the right male approaches and she turns purple, then the left male approaches, and of course, she stays purple. The two middle sentences said something like, ""the left male kept the female purple"" and ""the left male turned the female purple."" She stayed purple, but the left male didn't ""keep"" her purple; she only stayed purple because he happened to approach before the right male left. If he hadn't swam over, she would have turned brown - so essentially, he turned her purple rather than keeping her purple, I think. Anyway, I can't remember my answers for those two questions now, but they were based on that line of thinking. ","correct"
